    title: "Who will be helping me?",
    content: `After you sign up, we will match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences, and the type of issues you are dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of focus, so it's important to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. We have found that we are able to provide a successful match most of the time; however, if you start the process and you feel your therapist isn't a good fit for you, you may elect to be matched to a different therapist.`,

    title: "Who are the therapists?",
    content: `Therapists on Therapy-app are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (PhD / PsyD), licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFT), licensed clinical social workers (LCSW / LICSW), or licensed professional counselors (LPC). All of them have a Masters Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state's professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice. While their experience, expertise, and background vary, they all possess at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience.`,

  {
    title: "How are the therapists verified?",
    content: `Our team ensures that every provider we bring to the platform is fully licensed and in good standing. Providers who apply are required to provide proper licensure documentation and proof of identity. We then cross-check their licensure information with their respective state licensing board.
  
      In addition to checking credentials, each potential provider needs to complete a case study exam graded by a licensed clinician and be evaluated in a video interview. The result of this rigorous process is that only about 25% of applicants who apply to work as therapists through BetterHelp are accepted to the platform.
      
      We also show the full licensing information for each provider to make it easy for you to do your own due diligence on your therapist.`,
